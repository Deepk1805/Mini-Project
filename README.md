# Summer Internship Report: Demonstrate Load Balancer Balancing Load in Different Regions

## Overview

This repository contains the summer internship project report titled **"Demonstrate Load Balancer Balancing Load in Different Regions"** submitted to the Department of Computer Engineering & Applications, Institute of Engineering & Technology, GLA University, Mathura, by students of the 2022-2026 batch.

## Project Description

The report explores the concept of load balancing in computer networks, focusing on how load balancers distribute network traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization, reduced latency, and improved reliability. The project demonstrates various load balancing algorithms and their implementation in different regions, with a special emphasis on AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)[1].
